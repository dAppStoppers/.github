## Motivations

Most web3 mobile games are banned on the Google Playstore and App Store because these games are against the Terms of Service of the mentioned appstore. In addition, these appstores impose hefty taxes on in-game purchases which we feel is unfair to the game developers.

In the spirit of censorship resistance and giving power back to creators, dAppStore aims to provide a fair platform for both web3 mobile game developers and players.

The current appstores are also lacking a social aspect, if implemented, could boost the audience of the Dapps distributed on the platform.

## Solution

A censorship-resistant Dapp distribution platform
